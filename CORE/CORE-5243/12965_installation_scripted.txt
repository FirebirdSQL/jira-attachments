Parameters specific to Firebird installs
----------------------------------------

HELP
  Invoke this file as a help screen at installation time.
  Note no / is prefixed !! Because /? and /HELP are now 
  used by innosetup itself to dispaly innosetup specific help.

/COMPONENTS="comma separated list of component names"

  Choose from - ServerComponent,
                DevAdminComponent and
                ClientComponent

  Overrides the default components settings. Using this command line
  parameter causes Setup to automatically select a custom type. A full
  install requires combining components. For example:

  /COMPONENTS="ServerComponent,DevAdminComponent,ClientComponent"

  would be required for a full install.

/TASKS="comma separated list of task names"

  Specifies a list of tasks that should be initially selected or
  deselected. To deselect a task, prefix its name with a "!" character.

  Choose from - UseSuperServerTask
				UseSuperServerTask\UseGuardianTask
				UseSuperClassicTask
				UseSuperClassicTask\UseGuardianTask
				UseClassicServerTask
				UseApplicationTask
				UseServiceTask
				AutoStartTask
				CopyFbClientToSysTask
				CopyFbClientAsGds32Task
				EnableLegacyClientAuth


  Only the specified tasks (and their children) will be selected; the rest
  will be deselected. Use the /MERGETASKS parameter instead if you want to
  keep the default set of tasks and only select/deselect some of them.

  By default the following tasks are run:

	UseSuperServerTask,UseServiceTask,AutoStartTask,CopyFbClientToSysTask 

/MERGETASKS="comma separated list of task names"

  Like the /TASKS parameter, except the specified tasks will be merged
  with the set of tasks that would have otherwise been selected by
  default.

  If UsePreviousTasks is set to yes, the specified tasks will be
  selected/deselected after any previous tasks are restored.


/SYSDBAPASSWORD="mypassword"

  If supplied this will override the default SYSDBA password "masterkey".
  
  NOTE: If an existing Security database is found this parameter will be 
  ignored.


/FORCE

  Tells the installer to ignore its analysis of the existing
  environment. It will attempt to install and configure Firebird as
  if no previous version of Firebird or InterBase was installed.

  This can be useful if you have a seriously broken installation that
  you cannot uninstall. Or it could be another way to aggravate your
  users by breaking a perfectly good working install of Firebird or InterBase.
  Its your choice.

  
  
Parameters specific to Firebird uninstalls
------------------------------------------

/CLEAN

  Uninstallation has always left the following files in place after
  the uninstallation process has completed:

    firebird.conf
    databases.conf
    firebird.log
    security3.fdb
	fbtrace.conf

  The assumption is that these files will be useful to users
  re-installing or upgrading Firebird. Starting with Firebird 2.1
  (using InnoSetup 5 to build the installation package) it is now
  possible to pass the /clean option to remove these files.
